That's why I made it this service pattern.\r\n\r\nI understand, but in the context of the Discord bot, we require two services: `ISpeechService` and `ITranscriptionService`. (Also, there are `IVideoService` and `IBrowserService`, but I'm not sure if these are necessary for the bot.) Would you prefer that I implement separate methods and instance variables for each of these services, or would you prefer a different approach? Let me know how you'd like to proceed :)",

This means only one instance of each subclass is created and reused. Could you clarify if the intent is different?",
