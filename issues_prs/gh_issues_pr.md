  "number": 1234,
  "title": "Sample Pull Request",
  "state": "open",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01 10:00:00",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-02 15:30:00",

  "review_comments": 2,
  "messages": [
    {
      "number": 0,
      "type": "body",
      "author": "username",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01 10:00:00",
      "body": "..."
    },

      "type": "review_comment",
      "author": "reviewer",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01 12:00:00",
      "body": "...",
      "path": "src/main.js",
      "line": 42,
      "commit_id": "abc1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

### CSV Format
Outputs in CSV format, ideal for spreadsheet analysis. Includes all base fields and can include messages when requested.

## Message Types

When using `-v` or `-m` flags, the tool fetches three types of messages:

1. **body** (message #0): The original issue/PR description
2. **comment**: Regular comments on the issue/PR
3. **review_comment** (PR only): Code review comments with additional context:
   - File path
   - Line number
   - Commit hash

Messages are sorted chronologically and numbered sequentially.

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:
- GitHub CLI installation/authentication checks
- Invalid repository format detection
- API rate limiting handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Missing field handling
- Debug mode for detailed error information

## Limitations

- Requires GitHub CLI installation and authentication
- Subject to GitHub API rate limits
- Performance may be slower for repos with many issues/PRs when using `-v`
- CSV format may not handle newlines in messages well
- Review comments are only available for PRs
